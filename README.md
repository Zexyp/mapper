# mapper
This project is about reading binary mesh files from [Mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz/) (similar site to Google Maps).

## Map Tile Viewer
A simple way to preview tiles. Also can preview textures but the UV data is kinda broken now. It's possible to preview more tiles at once.
I'm not very knowledgeable of WPF and this is my second time trying it. It's made just to see something with it.

### 2025 update
I still don't know what I'm doing.
Inspired by Melown Technologies.
